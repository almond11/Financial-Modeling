Credit card fraud is a growing issue with many challenges including temporal drift and heavy class imbalance. This project attempts to tackle class imbalance using state-of-the-art techniques including Adaptive Synethtic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) and Synethetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Over 280k real transactions made in Europe in September 2013 [1] are used as the training dataset. Three types of machine learning models are compared: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Results show that the optimal sampling method for an imbalanced dataset is dependent on the dataset and the model being used.
